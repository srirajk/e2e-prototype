# Architectural Evolution and Modernization

## Overview

This README details the transformation from a traditional, less flexible architecture to a cutting-edge, scalable, and efficient infrastructure. The modernization emphasizes seamless integration with external services and leverages a Lakehouse architecture, enhancing data management, reducing duplication, and preparing our infrastructure for future analytical capabilities.

## Evolution from Legacy to Modern Architecture

### Legacy System Overview

- Predominantly manual operations with significant scalability challenges.
- Utilized Java and Talend for ETL tasks, introducing scalability and maintenance issues.
- Inefficient and delayed data validation and risk assessments.
- Depended on traditional databases and file systems, leading to bottlenecks.

### Transition to Modern Architecture

- Identified the need for scalable, real-time processing capabilities.
- Developed a prototype leveraging Apache Spark and messaging systems for distributed processing and data streaming.
- Reevaluated data flows, processing logic, and storage mechanisms to adopt big data technologies.

### Core Components of the Modern Architecture

#### Lakehouse Architecture

Adopting a Lakehouse architecture addresses the limitations of the legacy system by merging the flexibility of data lakes with data warehouses' management features:

- **Delta Lake**: Supports ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and schema enforcement, reducing data duplication and ensuring consistency.
- **Unified Data Management**: Acts as the central repository for operational data, enabling real-time analytics and machine learning directly on operational data.
- **Future-Proof Infrastructure**: Accommodates a wide range of analytical workloads, facilitating analytics on the operational datastore without data movement or replication.

#### Processing and Storage Components

- **Distributed Data Processing**: Apache Spark is chosen for its scalability, resilience, and data processing capabilities.
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion and Streaming**: A messaging system ensures high throughput and fault tolerance for real-time data ingestion and processing.
- **Scalable Data Storage**: NFS/S3 is used for secure and scalable data storage, supporting increasing data volume and accessibility demands.

### Strategic Decisions Behind the Modernization

1. **Apache Spark**: Selected for scalable and efficient large-scale data processing.
2. **Lakehouse Architecture with Delta Lake**: Enhances data management and prepares the system for advanced analytics and machine learning.
3. **Messaging System**: Provides a flexible, scalable approach to real-time data flow management.

## Architectural Benefits and Future Directions

This architectural overhaul prepares us to handle current challenges and future data technology advancements, laying a solid foundation for leveraging big data efficiently.

## Integration Strategy for External Services

Instead of direct API calls from data processing jobs, a strategic approach is employed to manage external data exchanges and integrations efficiently.

## Conclusion

Our journey towards modernized data architecture marks a significant advancement in our data processing, management, and analysis capabilities, ensuring agility, scalability, and forward-looking infrastructure.
# Wny not Integrating External REST APIs with Apache Spark

## Overview

Integrating external REST APIs into Apache Spark data processing pipelines presents unique challenges and considerations. This README explores two primary integration strategies: directly making API calls from Spark jobs and employing Spring Boot as an intermediary to manage API interactions. The choice between these methods depends on various factors, including scalability, performance, and system architecture considerations.

## Strategies for Integration

### Direct API Calls from Apache Spark

#### Overview

Directly integrating REST API calls within Spark jobs allows for straightforward data processing but may encounter scalability and performance issues.

#### Pros

- Simplifies architecture by eliminating additional components.
- Provides direct access to API data within Spark jobs.

#### Cons

- May overwhelm external APIs with high volumes of concurrent requests.
- Introduces complexity in error handling and rate limiting within Spark.

#### Ideal Use Cases

- Applications with low to moderate API request volumes.
- APIs capable of handling high loads with minimal latency.

### Using Spring Boot as an Intermediary

#### Overview

Utilizing Spring Boot as a mediator between Spark and external APIs offers improved scalability, error handling, and rate limiting.

#### Pros

- Decouples data processing and API calls, simplifying Spark jobs.
- Facilitates advanced error handling, caching, and request management.
- Enhances system reliability through Kafka's buffering and fault tolerance.

#### Cons

- Increases architectural complexity with additional components.
- Requires additional maintenance and operational oversight.

#### Ideal Use Cases

- High data and API request volumes.
- Systems requiring robust fault tolerance and scalability.

## Comparison and Considerations

When deciding between these strategies, consider factors such as the external API's capacity to handle requests, the volume of data being processed, and the criticality of data processing reliability and performance. Direct API calls may suffice for simpler, lower-volume use cases, while a Spring Boot intermediary is better suited for complex, high-volume environments.

## Conclusion

The optimal approach to integrating external REST APIs with Apache Spark depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. For environments where reliability, scalability, and performance are paramount, employing Spring Boot as an intermediary, with Kafka for messaging, provides a robust solution. For simpler scenarios, direct API calls from Spark might be adequate.
